# PeakShock

PeakShock is a mod for PEAK that connects supported shock devices (like PiShock and OpenShock) to in-game events. When you take damage or die in the game, your device will deliver a shock, adding a fun and challenging twist to your gameplay.

## Features
- Triggers real shocks based on in-game events (player death, injury, and more)
- Supports PiShock and OpenShock platforms
- You can enable or disable specific damage types
- Highly configurable to match your preferences

## Getting Started
1. Install the mod using a mod manager or manually.
2. Run the game once with the mod installed. This will generate the config file: `addzeey.PeakShock.cfg`.
3. Configure your device and preferences:
   - You can edit the config file manually (look for `addzeey.PeakShock.cfg` in your config folder), or use your mod manager's config editor.
   - Make sure to set the correct shock platform (PiShock or OpenShock).
   - Enable or disable specific damage types as you like.
4. Play PEAK and enjoy the extra challenge!
